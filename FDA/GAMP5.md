# GAMP 5 - Good Automated Manufacturing Practice

## Overview
GAMP 5 (from ISPE) is a framework for validating computerized systems in regulated environments like pharmaceuticals, biotech, and medical devices.

## GAMP 5 Core Principles
- **Risk-based approach:** Focus validation effort on areas impacting patient safety, product quality, and data integrity.
- **System classification:** Systems are categorized into 5 types (from Category 1: Infrastructure to Category 5: Bespoke/Custom applications).
- **Lifecycle approach:** Validation must span planning, specification, development, testing, and operation phases.

## GAMP 5 Lifecycle Phases
1. **Concept & Planning**
2. **Specification (URS, FS, DS)**
3. **Development & Configuration**
4. **Verification & Testing (IQ, OQ, PQ)**
5. **Operation & Maintenance**
6. **Retirement**

## GAMP Categories (Simplified)
| Category | Type                        | Example                         |
|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1        | Infrastructure              | OS, Database, Middleware         |
| 3        | Non-configurable Software   | Antivirus, Standard Office Tools |
| 4        | Configurable Software       | ERP with custom workflows        |
| 5        | Custom Software             | In-house clinical trial systems  |

## Summary
GAMP 5 helps structure how you validate systems based on their complexity and risk, and it's widely aligned with FDA and EU GMP expectations.
